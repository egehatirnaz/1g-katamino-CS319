### About Project
This repository is created for CS-319 2018 fall semester course project. The project's topic is implementing Katamino game with some additional concepts such as leaderboard with respect to time, and a new Challenge mode with an extra piece or pieces to make the game harder.

### What is Katamino?
Katamino is a puzzle game about geometrical perception. The game has 12 unique blocks with different shapes, a guidebook, a separator, and a board. The board is a typical rectangle. The board’s width is filled by 5 squares and its length is filled by 13 squares. There is a guidebook for each level and this book shows which shapes might be used for that level. The separator shows the current level of the game and it determines the limits of the shape. The levels are 3 to 12. The game's aim is to fill the squares with unique blocks which determined by guidebook with respect to current level. Each block consists of 5 cubes and these cubes merged in various types, so they are unique by their way of merging.
The game's purpose is to fill the blank squares with unique blocks.The player should take the guidebook for deciding which level to play. Then, the player should start with the first level, which is 3, and he/she should use only given blocks which specified by the guidebook. The player should pass each level after he/she finished it. The levels' specifications should be followed by the guidebook.

### Project Requirements
Java 8 will be used during the project as programming language. Eclipse will be used as IDE for implementing the program. Also, diagrams will be drawn on Visual Paradigm for reports and mockups will be drawn on Balsamiq 3 for user interface. PostgreSQL will be used for database system that will be used in program. Our plan is to run the program on any web browser. Therefore, GUI will be implemented by JavaScript Graphics Library(WebGL).  

### The Differences Between The Real Game and Our Project:
In the real “Katamino” game, players play the game without a prize system. In the one we will develop, players may gain points by the using of time efficiently. Moreover, game will have different modes such as there is a precise time for players to complete the whole missions (different expanding sizes of field in each play) by transferring time to the next mission so time
takes a significant role in the game too which is also absent in the real game experiment.

Players will use nicknames in the game and they will be ranked depending on their time usage.

What’s more, players have chance to improve the game while finding new solutions. Otherwise, they will get hints which are kind of helps depend on our solutions. Players also have a chance to either choose their cards which leads them in their game or given a random card by the system.

### What feautures do we plan adding to Katamino?
