### About Project
This repository is created for CS-319 2018 fall semester course project. The project's topic is implementing Katamino game with some additional concepts such as leaderboard with respect to time, and a new Challenge mode with an extra piece or pieces to make the game harder.

### What is Katamino?
Katamino is a puzzle game about geometrical perception. The game has 12 unique blocks with different shapes, a guidebook, a separator, and a board. The board is a typical rectangle. The board’s width is filled by 5 squares and its length is filled by 13 squares. There is a guidebook for each level and this book shows which shapes might be used for that level. The separator shows the current level of the game and it determines the limits of the shape. The levels are 3 to 12. The game's aim is to fill the squares with unique blocks which determined by guidebook with respect to current level. Each block consists of 5 cubes and these cubes merged in various types, so they are unique by their way of merging.
The game's purpose is to fill the blank squares with unique blocks.The player should take the guidebook for deciding which level to play. Then, the player should start with the first level, which is 3, and he/she should use only given blocks which specified by the guidebook. The player should pass each level after he/she finished it. The levels' specifications should be followed by the guidebook.

### Project Requirements
Java 8 will be used during the project as programming language. Eclipse will be used as IDE for implementing the program. Also, diagrams will be drawn on Visual Paradigm for reports and mockups will be drawn on Balsamiq 3 for user interface. PostgreSQL will be used for database system that will be used in program. Our plan is to run the program on any web browser. Therefore, GUI will be implemented by JavaScript Graphics Library(WebGL).  

### The Differences Between The Real Game and Our Project:
Time: We are planning to add time feature in order to compare the success of different users. The time will be shown on the upper right side of the screen.
