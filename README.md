### About Project
This repository created for CS319 2018 fall semester course project. The project's topic is implementing Katamino game with some additional concepts.

### What is Katamino?
Katamino is a puzzle game about geometrical perception. The game has 12 unique blocks with different shapes, a guide book, a separator and a board. The board is a typical rectangle. The board’s width is filled by 5 squares and its length is filled by 13 squares. There is a guide book for each level and this book shows which shapes might be used for that level. The separator shows current level of the game and it determines the limits of the shape. The levels are 3 to 12. The game's aim is to fill the squares with unique blocks which determined by guide book with respect to current level. Each block consists of 5 cubes and these cubes merged in various types, so they are unique by their way of merging.

### How to Play Katamino?
As mentioned above, the game's purpose is to fill the blank squares with unique blocks.
Player should take the guide book for deciding which level to play. Then, the player should start with first level, which is 3, and he/she should use only given blocks which specified by guide book. The player should pass each level after he/she finished it. The levels' specifications should be followed by the guide book.

### What feautures do we plan adding to Katamino?
* **Katamino with multiple players**: Katamino might be played with two
player. The game needs to be added another separator so, two separators will be located opposite numbers. For example, if first one is on the 3 another one is on 9. Nonetheless players can play at the same time and after level determines, players will begin at the same time and the winner will be the quickest player of current level. After a level finished the separators will close 1 level to each other. That means levels will be 4 and 8. The game's winner will be determined by the number of victories.

* **Joker piece feature**: In the game, players have a bunch of pieces in their
hand and they have chance to get more pieces. Players may get more
points when they finish the level they played earlier or with less action.
They will buy the pieces which are useful for them by the help of these
points. They can also play the game in the field they wanted with spending
these game points.

* **Sending and barter pieces**: Players may also play the game without being
rival. They can play individually and support each other to play more by
sending gifts like point or the pieces which are useless. All the pieces may
be bartered between the players according to their levels in the game.

* **Playing in another modes**: Players may also play the game with different
levels of difficulties and modes. Modes could be like starting the game from
different moments and give the players limited time to complete the
missions. Players may also play the game inside the different geometrical
shapes( like triangle or elips).

* **Making music or picture by playing the game**: All movement or action may
represent a sound which are small parts of a song. The song may
automatically separated by the software.

* **Getting hint**: All the pieces may carry a part of an image that is included in
computer but they are invisible while players play the game. In the hard
situations player may get hints from these photo kind of puzzle in order to
complete the mission.
