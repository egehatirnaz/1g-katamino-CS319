### About Project
This repository created for CS319 2018 fall semester course project. The project's topic is implementing Katamino game with some additional concepts.

### What is Katamino?
Katamino is a puzzle game about geometrical perception. The game has 12 unique blocks with different shapes, a guide book, a separator and a board. The board is a typical rectangle. The board’s width is filled by 5 squares and its length is filled by 13 squares. There is a guide book for each level and this book shows which shapes might be used for that level. The separator shows current level of the game and it determines the limits of the shape. The levels are 3 to 12. The game's aim is to fill the squares with unique blocks which determined by guide book with respect to current level. Each block consists of 5 cubes and these cubes merged in various types, so they are unique by their way of merging.

### How to Play Katamino?



#### General - How to Play:
The game consists of 12 different pieces constructed of right angled blocks so each
piece is made of 5 &quot;squares&quot;. (Think Tetris pieces, but 5 squares instead of 4.)

An old version of the game had only 10 pieces; the completely straight 5 square
and the 5 square &quot;plus sign&quot; were not included. Both versions also have a bunch of
&quot;filler&quot; pieces of 1 or 2 squares.

The gameboard is constructed with a movable divider so one can take sets of 4 up
to the whole set of 12 pieces and form them into a 5 block by X rectangle. (Where
X = the number of wood blocks in your set.)

The two or three player strategy game is accomplished on a square board divided
into 64 smaller squares. Players take turns to place a piece on the gameboard. The
first player who cannot place a piece anymore loses. (Similar to Blokus )

The two player puzzle game mode is accomplished by dividing the board into two
sections, each player chooses five blocks and are also given 4 small &quot;filler&quot; blocks
of 1 and 2 squares. The first one to fit all their blocks perfectly into their half of the
rectangle board, wins.

#### Additional Features:
* **Katamino with multiple players**: Katamino may also be played with two
player. It is played in the same field with two separators. Players are using
these separators step by step in each time. They don’t have time limitation
for this. That means the ones finished first will gain a point. In the next part,
the same process will be repeated in the next step( means with more
space) by giving to each other new pieces used in the game. In all games
some cards will lead you. In the software version of the game, a kind of
leading cards( or something else that leads players inside the game) will be
used. In each step the number of squares in the field will increase.

* **Joker piece feature**: In the game, players have a bunch of pieces in their
hand and they have chance to get more pieces. Players may get more
points when they finish the level they played earlier or with less action.
They will buy the pieces which are useful for them by the help of these
points. They can also play the game in the field they wanted with spending
these game points.

* **Sending and barter pieces**: Players may also play the game without being
rival. They can play individually and support each other to play more by
sending gifts like point or the pieces which are useless. All the pieces may
be bartered between the players according to their levels in the game.

* **Playing in another modes**: Players may also play the game with different
levels of difficulties and modes. Modes could be like starting the game from
different moments and give the players limited time to complete the
missions. Players may also play the game inside the different geometrical
shapes( like triangle or elips).

* **Making music or picture by playing the game**: All movement or action may
represent a sound which are small parts of a song. The song may
automatically separated by the software.

* **Getting hint**: All the pieces may carry a part of an image that is included in
computer but they are invisible while players play the game. In the hard
situations player may get hints from these photo kind of puzzle in order to
complete the mission.
